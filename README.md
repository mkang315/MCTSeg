This is the source code for the paper, "Multimodal Feature Distillation Based CNN-Transformer Hybrid Networks for MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation with Incomplete Modalities", of which I am the first author.
## Model
The model configuration (i.e., network construction) file is net.py in the directory .\model.
To train and test by running train.py and test.py.
## Performance
Datasets Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge 2018/2020 ([BraTS2018](https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2018.html)/[BraTS2020](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2020/)).
