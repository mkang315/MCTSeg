This is the source code for the paper, "Prior Knowledge Guided Incomplete Multimodality Brain Tumor Segmentation Using CNN-Transformer Hybrid Networks", of which I am the first author.
## Model
The model configuration (i.e., network construction) file is net.py in the directory .\model.
To train and test by running train.py and test.py.
## Performance
Datasets Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge 2018/2020 ([BraTS2018](https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2018.html)/[BraTS2020](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2020/)).
